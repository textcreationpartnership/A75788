         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O bluÅ¿h, and be aÅ¿hamed of that which you call your Church, who are Å¿o Å¿uddenly in a tumult! Was there ever Å¿uch a thing heard of amongÅ¿t the Saints, that they would be in a tumult, when one came in peaceably among them, not offering wrong to any? Here you Å¿hew your Å¿elves to be children of your Fathers who lived in envy, haling out of Synagogues, carrying them before Rulers, and caÅ¿ting into priÅ¿ons them who was called of the Lord to beare witneÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t their deceit; and here (him called the MiniÅ¿ter) is made manifeÅ¿t to be one that runs before he was Å¿ent, and Å¿o never profitted the people, and Å¿o like PrieÅ¿t, like People. Therefore give over, and never call it a Church, who are fighters and Å¿trikers, Å¿coffers and Å¿corners, tumulters and falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ers, as your fruits makes it daily appeare; And Å¿ome of you confeÅ¿Å¿e that they are in danger of their lives that comes among you, the people are Å¿o rude. Now you that are <hi>MagiÅ¿trates</hi> ought to puniÅ¿h evill Doers, Fighters, and Lyars, and falÅ¿e AccuÅ¿ers; but Å¿uch have liberty, and dare do it in your Church (as you call it) and you preÅ¿ent, as he that cauÅ¿ed the <hi>Mittimus</hi> to be made doth confeÅ¿Å¿e; That there was a tumult when he was preÅ¿ent, and they that tumulted are not puniÅ¿hed, but the fault is layd upon the innocent, who was beate and abuÅ¿ed, but offered violence to none: And Å¿o they Å¿aid <hi>Paul</hi> was a peÅ¿tilent fellow, and they tumulted <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:168069:3"/> did not cauÅ¿e the tumult: So you are made manifeÅ¿t of what generation you are, and you Å¿hall be rewarded according to your deeds: And from the Lord I declare, That he will viÅ¿ite for theÅ¿e things, and plead with you for all your hard Å¿peeches, and all your ungodly deeds: and give you your portion with hypocrites, except you Å¿peedily repent; and when you come into the pit, remember you are warned in your life time: And Å¿o your falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ation and blaÅ¿phemy I do deny, and the living God will judge between me and you.</p>
